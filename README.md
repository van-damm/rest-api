# RESTful API Project
## ðŸ““ Introduction
This project is about exploring different REST API patterns and methods. REST stands for 'Representational state transfer' and goes back to the web standards defined by the W3C. Web services that follow the REST constraints are referred to as RESTful.

## ðŸ’» Technologies
The example API will be implemented using Java and [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot). HTTP features that might be included are GET, POST, PUT or DELETE actions.
