# RESTful API Project
## ðŸ““ Introduction
This project is about exploring different REST API patterns and methods. REST stands for 'Representational state transfer' and goes back to the web standards defined by the W3C. Web services that follow the REST constraints are referred to as RESTful.

## ðŸ’» Technologies
The example API will be implemented using Java and [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot). HTTP enables different features that include actions like GET, POST, PUT or DELETE; caching, redirection/forwarding and security.
