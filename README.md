# RESTful API Project
## ðŸ““ Introduction
This project is about exploring different REST API patterns and methods. REST stands for 'Representational state transfer' and goes back to the web standards defined by the W3C. Web services that follow the REST constraints are referred to as RESTful. REST is not a standard itself but an architectural approach for building web-scale systems.

## ðŸ’» Technologies
The example Application Programming Interface (API) will be built using Java and [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot). HTTP enables different features that include actions like GET, POST, PUT or DELETE (based on CRUD); caching, redirection/forwarding and security.

## ðŸš© Installation
Different dependencies have to be added for the new project to run. They include Web, JPA (Java Persistence API) and some kind of database service.
